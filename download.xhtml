		<h1>INACTIVE - NO LONGER MAINTAINED</h1>
		<p>
			This project has been inactive since at least 2015. While the kernel extensions kept working
			for a few OS X releases, with Apple requiring notarization and moving away from kernel
			extensions in general (which is a good thing!), this project is no longer relevant.
		</p>

		<p>
			Old releases are still available until further notice in case they are helpful. If you really
			need the kernel extensions on more recent operating systems, you might try the notarized
			kernel extensions provided by the Tunneblick project:

					<h1>Download</h1>
					<p>
						The current TunTap version is provided as an installation package that can be installed
						on Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and 10.10 (Yosemite). Click to download the current
						release: <a
						href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/tuntaposx/tuntap_20150118.tar.gz">tuntap_20150118</a>.
					</p>

					<h2>Latest changes</h2>
					<h3>January 18, 2015</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Update documentation to reflect removal of startup items.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>November 4, 2014</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Generate a LINK_ON event on MAC address changes. This works around a problem with
						the DHCP client implementation using a stale MAC address after updating the network
						interface's address.</li>
						<li>Update compilation to only produce 64 bit binaries, which is appropriate for
						Mavericks and onwards.</li>
						<li>Modernize package generation to use pkgbuild and productbuild.</li>
						<li>Replace the startup items with launchd jobs.</li>
						<li>Code signatures for the kernel extensions as well as the installer, the signed
						extensions now work on Mavericks and Yosemite.</li>
						<li>Add extra synchronization in tap.kext to avoid a kernel crash triggered by quickly
						re-attaching an interface.</li>
						<li>Fix MTU enforcement calculation when writing to the character device.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>November 1, 2011:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Make the netmask address family fix work without knowledge of the struct ifaddr
						definition. This fixes a crash on Lion, where the layout of the structure has been
						changed, but at the cost of the fix no longer working for IPv6. I think this is OK
						though, since mDNSResponder has been fixed on Leopard and beyond to no longer require
						the hack.</li>
						<li>Proper multicast address checking for tun; multicast should now work reliably with
						IP and IPv6 on tun also.</li>
						<li>A quite comprehensive test suite has been added that allows for quick release
						testing.</li>
						<li>PPC support has been dropped due to XCode 4 no longer supporting PPC arch.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>September 13, 2009:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Change linker options to produce 64 bit kext bundle for Snow Leopard.</li>
						<li>Switch from kmem_alloc and friends to OSAlloc for memory allocation and avoid the
						delay() call. Respective symbols are not available on 64 bit kernels anymore.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>September 5, 2009:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Initial Snow Leopard port. Thanks to various people contributing patches in the
						bugtracker. The new official version can only be compiled on Snow Leopard but has been
						tested to work on all Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard</li>
						<li>Clean up unused locking code and switch to rwlocks even for simple mutexes, which
						avoids a symbol incompatibility for Tiger and Leopard.</li>
						<li>Clean up compilation flags in the Makefiles.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>July 4, 2008:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Adapt the former Leopard package to also be installable on Tiger systems. This
						obsoletes the Tiger version, both Leopard and Tiger are now supported by a single
						package.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>June 7, 2008:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Protect the selwakeup() call by the lock. This fixes incorrect select() behaviour,
						thanks to Roland Wendelin for reporting this.</li>
						<li>Fix tuntap_mbuf_queue::size initialization</li>
						<li>Use a proper wait condition for synchronization when detaching the network
						interface. The old code would crash if the if_detached() handler was called from a
						different thread than unregister_interface().</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>January 21, 2008:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Work around an issue in the Darwin kernel. When unregistering an interface,
						addresses are not properly removed from the interface. This leads to crashes and other
						problems when reusing the interface. Introduce an ugly hack that tries to remove all
						interface addresses when shutting the interface down.</li>
						<li>Fix a small mbuf leak that could occur when the output queue was full. Thanks to
						Oleg Dolgov for reporting this.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>December 21, 2007:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Fix paths in the startup item postflight scripts</li>
						<li>Check if_ioctl arguments more defensively after a report of a panic after receiving
						a NULL arg.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>November 14, 2007:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>I have done a complete rework of the installer package generation. The package is
						now edited in PackageMaker. The distribution package can still be built from the
						commandline though.</li>
						<li>Fix incorrect permission &amp; ownership of the installed files.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Oktober 11, 2007:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Fix the permissions of the postflight scripts. Installer packages should work
						again.</li>
						<li>Drop the kmod and kmodc++ in the linker command, they seem to be unneeded with
						Leopard.</li>
					</ul>

					<h1>Legacy versions</h1>
					<p>
						The following legacy packages can be used with previous Mac OS X versions. These reflect old versions current at the time of the respective Mac OS X versions. Since the base functionality provided by TunTap hasn't changed significantly over the years, these are mostly equivalent feature-wise.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Version <a
						href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuntaposx/files/tuntap%20panther/20050515/">20050515</a> for Mac
						OS X 10.3 (Panther)</li>
						<li>Version <a
						href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuntaposx/files/tuntap/20111101/">20111101</a> for Mac
						OS X 10.4 (Tiger), 10.5 (Leopard), 10.6 (Snow Leopard), 10.7 (Lion), 10.8 (Mountain Lion)</li>
						<li>The <a
						href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=235725">download page</a> has a complete archive of previous releases.</li>
