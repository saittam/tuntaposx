		<h1>INACTIVE - NO LONGER MAINTAINED</h1>
		<p>
			This project has been inactive since at least 2015. While the kernel extensions kept working
			for a few OS X releases, with Apple requiring notarization and moving away from kernel
			extensions in general (which is a good thing!), this project is no longer relevant.
		</p>

		<p>
			Old releases are still available until further notice in case they are helpful. If you really
			need the kernel extensions on more recent operating systems, you might try the notarized
			kernel extensions provided by the Tunneblick project:

					<h1>Overview</h1>
					<h3>What is it?</h3>
					<p>
						The TunTap project provides kernel extensions for Mac OS X that allow to create virtual
						network interfaces. From the operating system kernel's point of view, these interfaces
						behave similar to physical network adapters such as an Ethernet network interface.
						However, the virtual interface does not send the packets into a wire, but makes them
						available to programs running in the system.
					</p>
					<p>
						The software comes as a pair of kernel extensions that create virtual network interfaces
						on the IP and Ethernet level, respectively. These kind of network interfaces are
						commonly referred to as tun and tap devices on Unix-like platforms. This way of
						interfacing with the operating system's network stack is available on many platforms
						(cf. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP">TUN/TAP</a> wikipedia article).
					</p>
					<h3>Who needs it?</h3>
					<p>
						By design, virtual network interfaces can be very flexibly used by any program that
						wants to receive packets from and inject them into the network stack. Generally, tun and
						tap devices are most commonly used in two distinct application scenarios: The first one
						is VPN software (such as <a href="http://openvpn.net">OpenVPN</a>). In this scenario,
						the kernel sends its network packets to the tun or tap devices. The VPN software will
						then encrypt and forward them to the other side of the VPN tunnel where they get
						decrypted and delivered to their destination. The second area in which tun and tap
						devices are popular are system virtualization/emulation packages. In this case, the
						virtualized operating system instance talks to a fake network device (commonly a virtual
						Ethernet adapter). The virtualization software then creates a tap device and
						interconnects the two such that the host system can talk to the guest and vice versa.
					</p>
					<h3>How does it work?</h3>
					<p>
						The TunTap package is comprised of a pair of kernel extensions, one providing tun and
						one providing tap interfaces. They create a set of character devices
						<code>/dev/tunX</code> and <code>/dev/tapX</code>, respectively, where <code>X</code>
						is a number between zero and the maximum number of supported virtual interfaces. Once an
						application opens the character device, say <code>/dev/tap0</code>, a virtual network
						interface is created in the system, which will be named accordingly, i.e.
						<code>tap0</code>. The network interface can be assigned addresses just like any other
						network interfaces. After configuring the interface, packets that the kernel sends
						through this interface (as determined by the routing table) can be read one packet at a
						time from the character device. Likewise, packets written to the character device will
						be injected into the kernel's network stack. For tun interfaces, the packets that are
						read and written are IP packets. For tap interfaces, the packet format is Ethernet
						frames.
					</p>
					<h1>Mailing list</h1>
					<p>
						There is a mailing list available through the Sourceforge project that is meant for
						general discussion about the TunTap software, asking questions, reporting bugs etc. It
						is called <code>tuntaposx-users</code>. If you are interested, you can <a
						href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tuntaposx-users">register</a> or have
						a look at the <a
						href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=tuntaposx-users">archives</a>.
					</p>
					<h1>Donations</h1>
					<p>
						So far, I have spent my spare time to run this project. If you want to show your
						gratitude or support further maintenance or development of the software, you can donate
						either via the Sourceforge donation system or directly to me via PayPal, just click the
						appropriate button below. In either case, your money enables me to buy copies of
						upcoming Mac OS X releases as well as development machines. A huge thank you goes to the
						nice people at <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">mozilla.com</a> who have given me the
						Mac Mini I currently use as development machine.
