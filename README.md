# INACTIVE - NO LONGER MAINTAINED

This project has been inactive since at least 2015. While the kernel extensions
kept working for a few OS X releases, with Apple requiring notarization and
moving away from kernel extensions in general (which is a good thing!), this
project is no longer relevant.

Old releases are still available until further notice in case they are helpful.
If you really need the kernel extensions on more recent operating systems, you
might try the notarized kernel extensions provided by the Tunneblick project:
